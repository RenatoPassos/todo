= 3. Create a React Native TextInput

== 4:29  React lesson by Jason Brown

In this lesson we'll use TextInput to receive input from the user 
and save off separate items into state. We'll store the value on 
state, show how to setup specific keyboards to display and how to 
handle actions from the keyboard.
