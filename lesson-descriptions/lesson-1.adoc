= 1. Setup React Native for iOS and Android

== 4:48  React lesson by Jason Brown

In this lesson we'll walk through the process of installing the 
react-native-cli through setting up a basic react-native project 
on iOS. We'll get the basic project running in a simulator via 
XCode. We'll also setup Android, Android Studio and get the 
project running on an emulator with the react-native run-android 
command.
